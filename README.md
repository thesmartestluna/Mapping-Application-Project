# Web-Mapping-Application-Project
<p> This project, inspired by Google Map, is a web mapping application (from course CS61B in UC Berkeley). </p>
<p> I worked with real-world mapping data and developed the back end -- the web server that powers the API that the front end makes requests to. </p>
<p> The application has the following features:
  <ul>
    <li> Finding the shortest path between two points and display the route on map </li>
    <li> Displaying driving directions for the given route </li>
    <li> Autocomplete in search box </li>
    <li> Finding and marking on map the locations that the user searched </li>
    <li> Zooming in/out and dragging the map around </li>
   </ul>
