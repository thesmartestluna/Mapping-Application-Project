# Web-Mapping-Application-Project
<p> This project, inspired by Google Map, is a web mapping application from course CS61B in UC Berkeley. </p>
<p> I worked with real-world mapping data and developed the back end (i.e. the web server that powers the API that the front end makes requests to). </p>
<p> Users have access to the following features in the application:
  <ul>
    <li> Searching for locations and finding out where the locations are on map </li>

      </p>
    <li> Finding the shortest path between two points and reading the driving directions for the given route </li>
