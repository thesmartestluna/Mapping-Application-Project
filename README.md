# Web-Mapping-Application-Project
<p> This project, inspired by Google Map, is a web mapping application (from course CS61B in UC Berkeley). </p>
<p> I worked with real-world mapping data and developed the back end -- the web server that powers the API that the front end makes requests to. </p>
<p> Users have access to the following features in the application:
  <ul>
    <li> Searching for locations and finding out where the locations are on map </li>
    <img ![search](https://github.com/thesmartestluna/web-mapping-application/blob/main/image.jpg?raw=true)>
    <li> Finding the shortest path between two points and reading the driving directions for the given route </li>
    <li> Selecting autocompleted results in search box </li>
    <li> Zooming in/out and dragging the map aorund to exlore </li>
   </ul>
